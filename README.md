- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DamianWasTaken

- I'm a Brunel University Computer science Artificial intelligence Graduate
- Currently finishing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Brunel University

Context
- The purpose of this GitHub is to show employers  my skills applied in a development context
- This Git doesn't have commits/pushes prior to July 2021 as I've never had the need for it in individual projects(or so I foolishly thought), 
  but I have used it in an Agile development Academic context before, just with 
- Whilst Github is great for version control and several programmers working in the same project, We've found that using Google Drive and spoken communication made it easier 
  (due to the small nature of teams and projects) for us to have contributions in files that require the attention of more than one individual, such as Data Cleaning, EDA, 
  implementation of unsupervised ML methods, among other tasks. Thus the reasoning for not using Git during our MSc.
  
  Programming Languedges 
  - Whilst I do have projects priorly built during my BSc and MSc, all projects that will be pushed onto this Git are going to be built in the present so that employers
    have an accurate understanding of my capabilities and a notion of known languedges.
  
  Languedges/software known at the moment:
        -Java - Advanced
        -Python - Medium
        -R Studio - Advanced
        -Matlab - Medium
        -C# - Advanced
        -GitBash - Medium
